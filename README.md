## Instructions:
- Clone this repository to the directory of your choice. 

Note: To build and run this app, Node/NPM and NPX needs to be running on your system. 

Install Node and NPM: 
  - Mac: 
    - Using Homebrew: brew install node
  - Windows:
    - Using Chocolatey: choco install nodejs

Install NPX:
  - npm i npx
  

Open up a terminal and cd to the directory you created for the cloned repo.
Run the following commands:
npm install (or npm i)
npm start
At this point the Node server is firing up. Once it has started, if you have the Chrome browser installed, it will automatically open the app in a new Chrome tab. If you do not have Chrome, in the console you will see the URL for the local server. Typically it is http://localhost:3000/. Just copy and paste that url in the browser of your choice.
